Fasten
=====================

Fasten is a pattern (or framework) for neatly integrating your favourite front-end framework into your project in a manageable and upgradeable manner. It provides a method of breaking your styles into modules, without restricting access to common project settings and assets.

(I will, in time, provide more concise information into the structure of Fasten in this readme. However for now, please read my [blogpost on Fasten][0].)
