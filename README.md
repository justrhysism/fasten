Fasten
=====================

**Fasten** isn't a new framework. It's not a new tool. _Fasten is simply a pattern_. A pattern to fasten frameworks together and neatly integrate a project's theme in a maintainable, upgradable way.


(I will, in time, provide more concise information into the structure of Fasten in this readme. However for now, please read my [blogpost on Fasten][0].)
